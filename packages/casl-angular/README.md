This package allows to integrate `@casl/ability` with [Angular] application. It provides `AblePipe` and `AblePurePipe` to Angular templates, so you can show or hide components, buttons, etc based on user ability to see them.

## Installation

The latest version of this package is compiled by Ivy, so **apps that do not use Ivy are no longer supported.**

```sh
npm install @casl/angular @casl/ability
# or
yarn add @casl/angular @casl/ability
# or
pnpm add @casl/angular @casl/ability
```

## Configure AppModule

To add pipes into your application's templates, you need to import `AbilityModule` in your `AppModule` and

```ts @{data-filename="app.module.ts"}
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { AbilityModule } from '@casl/angular';
import { Ability, PureAbility } from '@casl/ability';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    // other modules
    AbilityModule
  ],
  providers: [
    { provide: Ability, useValue: new Ability() },
    { provide: PureAbility, useExisting: Ability }
  ]
  // other properties
})
export class AppModule {}
```

The 2nd provider provides instance of `PureAbility`, so pipes can inject it later. This pipes inject `PureAbility` (not `Ability`) because this allows an application developer to decide how to configure actions, subjects and conditions. Also this is the only way to get maximum from tree shaking (e.g., if you don't need conditions you can use `PureAbility` and shrink @casl/ability size).

> Read [CASL and TypeScript](https://casl.js.org/v5/en/advanced/typescript) to get more details about `Ability` type configuration.

## Update Ability instance

Majority of applications that need permission checking support have something like `AuthService` or `LoginService` or `Session` service (name it as you wish) which is responsible for user login/logout functionality. Whenever user login (and logout), we need to update `Ability` instance with new rules.

Let's imagine that server returns user with a role on login:

```ts @{data-filename="Session.ts"}
import { Ability, AbilityBuilder } from '@casl/ability';
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({ provideIn: 'root' })
export class Session {
  private token: string

  constructor(private ability: Ability) {}

  login(details) {
    const params = { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify(details) };
    return fetch('path/to/api/login', params)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then((session) => {
        this.updateAbility(session.user);
        this.token = session.token;
      });
  }

  private updateAbility(user) {
    const { can, rules } = new AbilityBuilder(Ability);

    if (user.role === 'admin') {
      can('manage', 'all');
    } else {
      can('read', 'all');
    }

    this.ability.update(rules);
  }

  logout() {
    this.token = null;
    this.ability.update([]);
  }
}
```

> See [Define rules](https://casl.js.org/v5/en/guide/define-rules) to get more information of how to define `Ability`

Then use this `Session` service in `LoginComponent`:

```ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { Session } from '../services/Session';

@Component({
  selector: 'login-form',
  template: `
    <form (ngSubmit)="login()">
      <input type="email" [(ngModel)]="email" />
      <input type="password" [(ngModel)]="password" />
      <button type="submit">Login</button>
    </form>
  `
})
export class LoginForm {
  email: string;
  password: string;

  constructor(private session: Session) {}

  login() {
    const { email, password } = this;
    return this.session.login({ email, password });
  }
}
```

## Check permissions in templates

To check permissions in any template you can use `AblePipe`:

```html
<div *ngIf="'create' | able: 'Post'">
  <a (click)="createPost()">Add Post</a>
</div>
```

> You can read the expression in `ngIf` as "if creatable Post"

## Why pipe and not directive?

Directive cannot be used to pass values into inputs of other components. For example, we need to enable or disable a button based on user's ability to create a post. With directive we cannot do this but we can do this with pipe:

```html
<button [disabled]="!('create' | able: 'Post')">Add Post</button>
```

## Performance considerations

There are 2 pipes in `@casl/angular`:

* `able` - impure pipe
* `ablePure` - pure pipe

So, when should we use which?

> If you are in doubt, then use `ablePure` for action and subject type checks, and `able` for all others

According to Angular documentation pure pipes are called only if their arguments are changed. This means that you **can't use mutable objects with pure pipes** because changes in that objects don't trigger pure pipe re-evaluation. But a good thing is that Angular creates only single instance of a pure pipe for the whole app and reuses it across components, this way it safes component instantiation time and memory footprint.

Due to [open feature in Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/15041), we need to pass the result of `ablePure` pipe to `async` pipe. So, instead of

```html
<div *ngIf="'create' | ablePure: 'Todo'">...</div>
```

we need to write:

```html
<div *ngIf="'create' | ablePure: 'Todo' | async">...</div>
```

> `ablePure` pipe returns an `Observable<boolean>`, so `async` pipe can effectively unwrap it

For apps that mutate application state, we need to use impure `able` pipe as it can detect changes in object properties. Don't worry, checks by action and subject type are very fast and are done in O(1) time. The performance of checks by action and subject object are a bit slower and depend on the amount of rules for a particular subject type and used conditions but usually this won't become a bottle neck for the app.

## TypeScript support

The package is written in TypeScript, so it will warn you about wrong usage.

It may be a bit tedious to use application specific abilities in Angular app because everywhere you inject `Ability` instance you will need to import its generic parameters:

```ts
import { Ability } from '@casl/ability';
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { AppAbilities } from '../services/AppAbility';

@Component({
  selector: 'todo-item'
})
export class TodoItem {
  constructor(
    private ability: Ability<AppAbilities>
  ) {}
}
```

To make the life easier, you can use `AbilityClass<TAbility>` class to utilize Companion object pattern:

```ts @{data-filename="AppAbility.ts"}
import { Ability, AbilityClass } from '@casl/ability';

type Actions = 'create' | 'read' | 'update' | 'delete';
type Subjects = 'Article' | 'User';

export type AppAbility = Ability<[Actions, Subjects]>;
export const AppAbility = Ability as AbilityClass<AppAbility>;
```

And use `AppAbility` everywhere in your app:

```ts @{data-filename="AppModule.ts"}
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { AppAbility } from './services/AppAbility';

@NgModule({
  // other configuration
  providers: [
    { provide: AppAbility, useValue: new AppAbility() },
    { provide: PureAbility, useExisting: AppAbility },
  ]
})
export class AppModule {}
```
