This package is the core of CASL. It includes logic responsible for [checking][check-abilities] and [defining][define-abilities] permissions.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @casl/ability
```

## Getting Started

CASL concentrates all attention at what a user can actually do and allows to create abilities in DSL style. Lets see how

### 1. Defining Abilities

`AbilityBuilder` allows to define abilities using DSL:

```js
import { AbilityBuidler } from '@casl/abiltiy'

const ability = AbilityBuilder.define((can, cannot) => {
  can('protect', 'Website')
  cannot('delete', 'Website')
})

class Website {}

console.log(ability.can('delete', new Website())) // false
```

If you would like to define abilities in own function, it'd better to use its `extract` method:

```js
import { AbilityBuidler, Ability } from '@casl/abiltiy'

function defineAbilityFor(user) {
  const { rules, can, cannot } = AbilityBuilder.extract()

  if (user.isAdmin) {
    can('manage', 'all')
  } else {
    can('read', 'all')
    can('manage', 'Post', { author: 'me' })
    cannot('delete', 'Post')
  }

  return new Ability(rules)
}
```

Also you can combine similar rules together:

```js
const { can, rules } = AbilityBuilder.extract()

can(['read', 'update'], 'User', { id: 'me' })
can(['read', 'update'], ['Post', 'Comment'], { authorId: 'me' })

console.log(rules)
```

See [Defining Abilities][define-abilities] for details.

### 2. Checking rules

Later on you can check abilities by using `can` and `cannot`.

```js
// true if user can read at least one Post
ability.can('read', 'Post')

// true if user cannot update a post
const post = new Post({ title: 'What is CASL?', authorId: 'not_me' })
ability.cannot('update', post)
```

See [Check Abilities][check-abilities] for details.

### 3. Serializing rules

As rules are plain objects, they can be easily serialized and cached in session or JWT token or even [saved to any database][store-rules] and added dynamically later in admin panel.

```js
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken')
const payload = {
  rules: ability.rules
}

jwt.sign(payload, secret, (error, token) => {
  if (error) {
    return next(error)
  }

  // later you can send this token to client
  // and restore Ability on the client using `jwt.verify`
  console.log(token)
})
```

See [Caching Abilities][cache-rules] for details.

### 4. Extra

This package also provides `@casl/ability/extra` submodule which contains helper functions that can construct a database query based on permissions or extract some information from them.

```js
import { rulesToQuery } from '@casl/ability/extra'

function ruleToSequelizeQuery(rule) {
  return rule.inverted ? { not: rule.conditions } : rule.conditions
}

function toSequelizeQuery(rules) {
  return rulesToQuery(rules, ruleToSequelizeQuery)
}

// now you can construct sequelize query based on Ability
const query = toSequelizeQuery(ability.rulesFor('read', 'Post'))
```

[@casl/mongoose](/packages/casl-mongoose) uses `rulesToQuery` function to construct queries to MongoDB database.

See [Storing Abilities][storing-abilities] for details.
